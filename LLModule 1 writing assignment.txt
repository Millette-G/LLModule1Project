Lambda School
After watching the interview with our CEO Austen Allred summarize what you think is different about Lambda School compared
to either a traditional college education or a coding bootcamp. Be sure to include both positive and potentially negative 
aspects. 
---The differences between Lambda School and traditional schools are obvious. The biggest one being the ISA. This makes
Lambda vested in our futures. Lambda is the only school that I have herd of that not just cares if there students succeed, 
but actualy NEEDS it's students to succeed. Lambda only succeeds if it's students succeed! Other schools could care less about
it's students, THEY STILL GET PAID!
---As far as negative aspects of Lambda School, I haven't found any yet. But if there are any, I will find them. 


Spirit of Independent Learning
After watching the TEDx video by Barbara Oakley answer these questions:

What are the two modes of thinking described in this video?
---The two modes are Focused mode and Diffuse mode.

Do you think the Pomodoro technique would help you with procrastination?
---Maybe, but I don't want to think about it right now. No, seriously I will try 25 minutes of work then relax for a few 
minutes doing something fun. I'm hopeing this will stop me from trying to cram too much info into my brain all in one sitting.


Describe what is meant by “Illusions of Competence in Learning”.
---It's when you think your learning all of the materal at once, but it is better to go over it several seperate times so 
you don't have the illusion of learning it all. And you then know that you gave your brain several seperate chances to get it.

What are some studying tips that you might implement after watching this video?
---Look at the materal, and then look away and try and recall what the materal was. 
---Go over the materal several seperate times.
---Give myself mini tests to help retain what was learned.


Outcomes Based Assessment
How are outcome based assessments different from traditional testing?
---You don't end up with lazy students barly learning, but still passing the class just like the students that worked hard
and studied, only to end up with the same degree(but NOT the same knowledge).


Describe what a “1”, “2” and “3” mean on assessments
---(1) = < expectations
---(2) = === expectations 
---(3) = > expectations

Describe the process of “flexing” at Lambda School
---Flexing is when you qualify to go back to the previous unit, because you failed two sprint challenges.
